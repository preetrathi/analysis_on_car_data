## Questions to Answer
1. **What different types of make are there in our dataset, and what is the count (occurrence) of each make in the dataset?**
   - To answer this question, we will provide a list of car makes along with the count of each make in the dataset.

2. **Show all the records where the origin is Asia or Europe?**
   - We will present a filtered dataset showing only the car records where the origin is either Asia or Europe.

3. **Removing all the records where weight is above 4000?**
   - We will demonstrate the dataset after removing all the records where the weight of the cars exceeds 4000.

4. **Increase all the values of 'MPG_city' by 3?**
   - We will showcase the dataset with the 'MPG_city' values increased by 3 for all car records.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis includes information about various car attributes, such as make, model, MPG (Miles Per Gallon), weight, origin, and more.

## Analysis
The analysis is carried out using a combination of programming languages, libraries, and tools, such as Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks. Each question is addressed in a separate analysis section within the notebook.
